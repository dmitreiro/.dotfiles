My system dotfiles/configs.

When linking `nvim`, don't forget to clone [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) before first start:

`git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim`

Same happens with `tmux`, but this time you need to clone [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm):

`git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm`
